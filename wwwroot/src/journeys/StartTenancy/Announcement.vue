    <p>Let's get started creating a new tenancy.  You will need the following information;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The address of the property you're renting out</li>
      <li>The type of tenancy agreement</li>
      <li>The start/end date</li>
      <li>The agreed amount of rent, and how often it will be paid</li>
      <li>The name of all the occupiers (tenants)</li>
      <li>And a few other bits and bobs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It will probably take 20 minutes to complete this bit, and we will help you best we can along the way</p>
